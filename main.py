    ------------------------------------------
    A code which will train itself from going through songs on youtube and given genres for them.
    Next any song given as input, user will be given the output(predicted genre).
    Planning to use Classification algorithms for predicting and training data. Also supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.
    Need to find a module or an api for fetching songs from youtube at a fixed frequency or same quality.
